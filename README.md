## Getting Started

### First, install dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

### Second, set up env variables:

1. Rename file `template.env.local` to `.env.local` at the root of the project.
2. Replace the `FLUID_APP_ID`'s value with your app id and `FLUID_API_TOKEN`'s value with your api token found in the developer settings.
3. If you would like to consume a hosted version of Fluid (for local development probably) specify where the Fluid API is with `FLUID_BASE_URL`. Probably only useful for Fluid employees.

### Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
